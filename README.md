# Code Quiz

For this project I created a timed quiz using one html file, one css file, and one javascript file. This is a timed quiz to check to see if you know the content of developing all the way up to javascript. 

**Quiz Rules**
 
* WHEN I click the start button
* THEN a 30 second timer starts and I am then presented with a question
* WHEN I answer that question
* THEN I am presented with another question
* WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
* THEN time goes by twice as fast, until I answer the next question correctly
* WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
* THEN the game is over
* WHEN the game is over
* THEN I can save my initials and score into the highscores sections

Lets see how good you are!!:
